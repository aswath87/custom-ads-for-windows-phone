Features 
============================
1. You don't need to host a server! : You just need to host a config file somewhere. I use a dropbox public file to host my config file. 
2. Supports multiple ads, weightage for every ad (how often an ad should be displayed) etc. 
2. Offline mode: Once ads are loaded, this works offline too. 
3. You can use it along with any other AdControl - so you get to push your own ads or display ads from a different ad provider or mix them up.
